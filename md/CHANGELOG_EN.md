## Release Notes: QWeather Pro 2026

### 🛠 [1.1.0] - 2026-06-02 (Milestone)

### 🌍 Full‑chain Internationalization (I18N)
- Automatic system language sync: The integration now automatically detects and follows Home Assistant’s system language in real time (supports 30+ global languages).
- Intelligent language fallback: Due to API limitations for “minutely precipitation” and “lifestyle indices”, an automatic fallback mechanism is implemented. When HA is set to a non‑Chinese/English language, these fields will gracefully fall back to English to ensure stable output for global users.
- Conditional entity loading: The Weather Summary entity is now language‑aware. It is only created when the system language is Chinese or English. Switching to other languages and reloading will automatically remove this entity to keep the UI clean and localized.

### 📡 API Host Adaptation (Mandatory from 2026‑06‑01)
- Public domain shutdown compliance: Fully aligned with QWeather’s announcement regarding the shutdown of public domains on June 1, 2026. All hardcoded domains such as `api.qweather.com` have been removed, enforcing the use of personal API Host.
- GeoAPI path restructuring: Automatically adapts to the updated geographic query path changes (v2 → geo/v2). Users only need to enter the Host domain; the integration handles all version path adjustments internally.

### 🛡️ Industrial‑grade Resiliency & Self‑Healing
- Dual‑layer retry protection: Introduces the Tenacity library with exponential backoff retry. For transient network jitter, the system retries silently in the background while keeping the UI smooth and uninterrupted.
- Smart degradation mode (Circuit Breaker): When persistent network failures or API quota exhaustion are detected, the integration automatically reduces the refresh frequency to once per hour to prevent IP blocking due to excessive requests.
- Cold‑start self‑healing: Fixes the long‑standing issue where entities remain “permanently unknown” after HA restarts due to network unavailability. If the initial refresh fails, the integration will retry aggressively until the first valid data is obtained, instead of waiting for long update intervals.

### 📍 Geographic Data Normalization
- Multi‑mode input conversion: The location field now supports “city name”, “city ID”, and “latitude/longitude”. Regardless of what the user enters, the integration automatically standardizes it into precise coordinates during configuration.
- Coordinate‑driven API requests: To fully leverage the precision of V1 Alerts and V1 Air Quality APIs (1×1 km resolution), all backend requests are now unified under coordinate‑based queries, eliminating issues caused by city‑ID‑based requests.

### 📊 Platinum‑grade Data Alignment (Professional Data)
- Professional Air Quality (V1): Upgraded AQI API from V7 to V1. Now provides station‑level pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, NO₂, O₃, etc. with units), detailed health impact descriptions, and protection advice for different groups.
- Deep alert parsing: Fully replicates QWeather’s V1 alert protocol, including issuing agency, defense guidelines (Instruction), alert color level, and all extended fields.
- Lossless attribute preservation: Rebuilt the data dictionary to ensure 100% preservation of all 16+ real‑time weather attributes, and added advanced parameters such as Moon Phase, UV Index, and Day/Night conditions.

### 🚀 Architectural Modernization
- Runtime Data & Strong Typing: Fully adopts HA 2026.5’s `ConfigEntry.runtime_data` standard combined with PEP 695 type aliases.
